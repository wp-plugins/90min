= Posts injection =
Posts are fetched every 30 minutes when the WP-Cron function is being prompted. This function executes scheduled events in your WordPress install and is not prompted when there is no traffic. In order to avoid missing posts we recommend you to replace WP-Cron with a real Cron job by following these steps:

1. Disable `wp-cron.php`

You can disable WP-cron by modifying the `wp-config.php` (located in the folder where WordPress is installed). Open the `wp-config.php` file and add the following line to the top of the page:

`define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);`


2. Set Up a Real Cron

Note: It is important that you familiarize yourself with how cron jobs work. You need to have a working knowledge of Linux commands before you can use cron jobs effectively.
To set up a real cron job:

Log into your cPanel.
In the Advanced section, click Cron jobs.
Under Add New Cron Job, select the time interval. HostGator recommends that you do not set the interval lower than 15 minutes.
Set the cron command to the following, replacing yourwebsite.com with your actual domain name:

`wget -q -O - http://yourwebsite.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron >/dev/null 2>&1`

The above command tells the Linux server to run wp-cron via wget, which will trigger the `wp-cron.php` script to do it's job on your schedule instead of on each page view. This will lessen the amount of processes on the server. 
Click Add New Cron Job to set the cron.

In order to test out the new cron, simply wait for the elapsed time period for the cron to run. In the event that the cron does not run, please review the steps listed above to ensure that you have completed all steps correctly.
